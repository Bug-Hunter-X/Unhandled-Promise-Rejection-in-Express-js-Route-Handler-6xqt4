# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications where an unhandled promise rejection within an asynchronous route handler leads to a silent failure without sending an appropriate error response to the client.  The server might log the error, but the client receives no indication of the problem.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application with a route handler that performs an asynchronous operation. If the operation fails, the error is caught and logged, but no error response is sent to the client, leading to a potentially confusing user experience.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version of the code. It includes explicit error handling within the route handler to send appropriate error responses to the client when exceptions occur during asynchronous operations.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install express` to install the Express.js dependency.
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the server with the buggy code.
5. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000/`.  The server might log an error, but the client will receive a seemingly successful response or time out.
6. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the server with the corrected code.
7. Make a request to `http://localhost:3000/`. Now the client will receive a proper error response.

## Lessons Learned

Always handle promise rejections explicitly within asynchronous route handlers to ensure robust error handling and provide informative responses to clients.
